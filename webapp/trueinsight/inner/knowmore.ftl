        <h4>A Personal note from the founder of True Insight!</h4>
        <h2>Hello. I am Dhanush Gangatkar. </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="container text-justify">
    <p>Greetings to all! With two years of intense research and underpinnings, a platform with an intention is created. The intention is to make tracking behaviour easy, convenient and accessible to the parents and teachers of this modern era. The platform helps record children's developmental stages ranging from milestones to learning concerns and behavioural difficulties to adolescent challenges. </p>
	<br/>
	<p>By realizing how important it is for parents and teachers to raise children with good behaviour and also by understanding the difficulty in tracking and impelling children's behaviour at various stages of development, here, lies a straightaway solution by True Insight. Through this platform, you gain total advantage on tracking and rewarding your child's constructive behaviour at various developmental stages. It also builds a strong, healthy bond between you and your child/ student- all this, with a sole emphasis on enhancing individuals, thereby the society on the whole.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>You have probably arrived here with the knowledge and realisation of how crucial it is to track your child's developmental milestones, core behaviour and mannerisms in order to foster their development and help them in functioning optimally, independently and confidently. True insight is purpose-built to meet these vital needs of parents, teachers and professionals working with children as we help children overcome issues and challenges through rewards and reinforcements, whilst shaping their behaviour and also their attributes of personality.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>So let me walk you through the initiative.</p>
	<br/>
	<h4>What is Behavioural tracking?</h4>

	<p>Large and emerging studies with scientific evidence shows that behavioural tracking helps in finding a lot of early-stage developmental challenges, difficulties in achieving age-appropriate milestones, various learning concerns and behavioural issues among children, adolescents and adults. Children's experiences in the first few years of life have an impact on how they develop, learn, and interact with the world. This period is manifested by an extraordinary amount of growth, and sets a foundation for future learning and ongoing development. As children grow, they carry the knowledge and experiences forward which reflect on their personality and overall development.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Considering this, the most effective method for tracking and structuring behaviour has been devised by True Insight. </p>
	<br/>

	<p>True insight's behaviour tracking is a highly effective scientific solution for the modern day education system, which can potentially help in enhancing good behaviour and in eliminating, if any, deviant behaviour of the students.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An interesting fact is that a number of recent researches show behavioural tracking over the internet to be, not just an alternative to teachers' observation, but in many cases, has actually proved to be more effective in addition to being more accessible, affordable and far more convenient.</p>
	<br/>
	



	<h4>Why True Insight?</h4>

	<p>Behavioural issues in childhood are barely noticed or generally ignored.  Even when noticed, it is disregarded with the thought that as children grow, they will acquire good behaviour in some way or the other. But, overwhelming evidence shows that not dealing with behavioural issues can potentially affect children's psychological health, and interfere with their personal and academic lives. </p>
	<br/>
	<p>Undoubtedly, teachers, parents and professionals working with children can mentor such issues formally and informally. But, it is definitely not the same as professionals or experts who exactly know the kind of mentorship required, who can help and guide in addressing these issues with an interdisciplinary approach. </p>
	<br/>
	<p>The founder of True Insight, along with a team of dedicated psychologists and industry experts have come together to ensure the creation of an accessible and user-friendly  scientific application to positively impact the lives of each individual, bring a change for the better, and develop  skills, good behaviour and mannerisms which help in promoting children's growth and personality.  </p>

	<br/>

	<h4>What is your current challenge?</h4>

	<p>Posing a question for the visitors of True insight-  </p>   
	<br/>
	<h4>Are good marks or ranks in academics enough to be better human beings? Or the way in which you behave, respect and interact with others also add value to your personality? </h4>

	<p>It is understandable that in real life situations, it is not easy to consolidate all of your concerns into one simple thought. But, you must be aware of how the behaviour of individuals contribute in progression of oneself at both personal and professional level. Thus, True Insight is one such scientific solution which is created to benefit the modern era parents, teachers and professionals working with children for better upbringing of individuals.</p>   
	<br/>

	<p>On a concluding note, it is best to mention that you have nothing to lose here, but only to profit from the start until the tracking of each and every child's development on various traits and parameters, helping them to improve behaviour and striving to create better individuals for a happy and healthy society. The journey until now has truly been a wonderful and rewarding experience. Sincerely hoping a remarkable experience for you, too.</p>   
	<br/>
 
	<p>True Insight is always ready for you. Good luck on your journey! </p>
